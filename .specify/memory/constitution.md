# Laravel React Starterkit Constitution

## Core Principles

### Clean Code Architecture
Write clean, maintainable and well-structured code. All code must follow SOLID principles, have clear separation of concerns, and maintain high readability standards. Code should be self-documenting through meaningful variable/function names and proper organization.

### Modular Design
Implement modular architecture with proper encapsulation. Components, services, and modules should have single responsibilities, be independently testable, and promote reusability while minimizing coupling between different parts of the system.

### Laravel React Starterkit Best Practices
Follow established best practices for Laravel React Starterkit development using Inertia 2, Shadcn UI components, and React 19. All implementations must align with the patterns and conventions of the stack, including proper state management, component lifecycle, and server-client communication through Inertia.

### Component Reusability
Prioritize reusable and composable components across the React application. Components should be designed with flexibility in mind, using proper props interfaces, avoiding unnecessary dependencies, and following established design system patterns.

### API Consistency
Maintain consistency in API design patterns between Laravel backend and React frontend. Follow RESTful conventions, use consistent naming patterns, implement proper error handling, and ensure clear contract definitions between client and server layers.

## Technology Standards

Laravel React Starterkit (Inertia 2, Shadcn UI, React 19) technology stack requirements. All development must utilize the established framework patterns, follow security best practices, implement proper authentication flows, and maintain compatibility with the selected technology ecosystem.

## Development Workflow

Code review requirements include verification of architectural compliance, testing coverage validation, and adherence to established coding standards. Pull requests must demonstrate proper implementation of Laravel and React best practices with clear documentation of any architectural decisions.

## Governance

All development practices must comply with this constitution. Amendments require documentation of changes, approval from core team members, and a migration plan for existing codebase. All PRs and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
