# Feature Specification: Vehicle Rental Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i would like to build vehicle rental web. The users can choose how many days, weeks, months to rent the vehicle. There is some category vehicle (Motorcyles and Cars) and Every vehicle has a badge (Luxury, Sport, City, Touring Etc). There's a package that can make the vehicle price more cheaper or added some features for the package instead of just rent 1 vehicle. The users must be authenticated to rent the vehicle from the website. And for the orders, the users must text us via Whatsapp. Then i would like to add admin dashboard. The dashboard can check everything like the available vehicle to rent (calendar), user vehicle rent, add a new vehicle and rent order history."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A customer visits the vehicle rental website, browses available vehicles (motorcycles and cars) with their specific badges (Luxury, Sport, City, Touring, etc.), selects a rental period (days, weeks, months), optionally chooses a package for discounts or additional features, authenticates with their account, and places a rental request. An admin user accesses the dashboard to manage vehicles, view rental calendars, monitor orders, and track rental history.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer has selected a vehicle and rental duration, **When** the customer authenticates and completes the rental process, **Then** the system creates a rental order and marks the vehicle as unavailable during the selected period
2. **Given** an admin user accesses the dashboard, **When** the admin views the calendar, **Then** the system displays available and rented vehicles with their statuses over time
3. **Given** an admin user wants to add a new vehicle, **When** the admin inputs vehicle details in the dashboard, **Then** the system adds the vehicle to the available rental inventory
4. **Given** a rental period has ended, **When** the system checks rental status, **Then** the system marks the vehicle as available again

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a customer wants to rent a vehicle that is already booked during the selected period?
- How does the system handle customers who fail to authenticate before attempting to rent?
- What happens when a vehicle is damaged during a rental period?
- How does the system handle customers who exceed the rental period?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: How should the WhatsApp integration for rental orders be implemented? ‚Üí A: System sends WhatsApp message automatically to staff when customer places order
- Q: What authentication method should users use to register and authenticate? ‚Üí A: Phone number verification only
- Q: How should the system handle situations where a customer tries to book a vehicle that's already reserved for the same time period? ‚Üí A: System blocks the booking and shows available alternatives immediately
- Q: How should the system handle rental pricing - should it be per day, week, month, or combination? ‚Üí A: Daily rate with discounts for weekly/monthly rentals
- Q: What user role permissions should the admin dashboard have compared to regular customers? ‚Üí A: Admins can do everything; customers only rent/borrow
