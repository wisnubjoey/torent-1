# Research for Vehicle Rental Web Application

## Decision: Technology Stack
**Rationale**: Using Laravel React Starter Kit with Inertia 2, Shadcn UI, and React 19 as specified in the constitution. This provides a modern full-stack solution with server-side rendering capabilities through Inertia.js.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Traditional API approach with separate frontend and backend: Would require CORS handling and more complex state management
- Vue.js or Angular instead of React: React 19 offers better component composition and lifecycle management

## Decision: Database Choice
**Rationale**: PostgreSQL was chosen based on user requirements for the vehicle rental application. It offers advanced data types, JSON support, and strong consistency which are important for a rental management system.

**Alternatives considered**:
- MySQL: While widely used, PostgreSQL offers better handling of complex queries and data integrity
- SQLite: Not suitable for production applications with concurrent users
- MongoDB: Would complicate relationships between rentals, vehicles, and users

## Decision: Authentication Method
**Rationale**: Phone number verification only, as specified in the feature requirements. This can be implemented using Laravel's built-in authentication with a custom verification flow.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Email authentication: Not requested by the user
- Social logins (Google, Facebook): Not requested by the user
- Traditional username/password: Not requested by the user

## Decision: Admin and User Dashboard Structure
**Rationale**: Separate layouts for admins and users, as specified in the requirements for better code maintainability. This allows for role-based access control and specialized UI components for each user type.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single layout with role-based component rendering: Would lead to more complex components and potential security issues
- Completely separate applications: Would increase development and maintenance overhead

## Decision: WhatsApp Integration for Orders
**Rationale**: Using WhatsApp Business API or simple HTTP requests to WhatsApp's API to send rental orders as specified in requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Email notifications: Requires user to check email
- SMS: More expensive and less user-friendly
- Push notifications: Would require user to have the app installed

## Decision: Rental Pricing Strategy
**Rationale**: Daily rates with discounts for weekly and monthly rentals, as specified in the feature requirements. This allows for flexibility in rental periods while providing incentives for longer rentals.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed rates per period: Less flexible for custom rental periods
- Hourly rates: Not suitable for longer-term vehicle rentals
- Seasonal pricing: Would add unnecessary complexity initially
